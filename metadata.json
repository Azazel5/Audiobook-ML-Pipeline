She is innocent and unaware of his intentions, but her father and childhood sweetheart, Johann, are suspicious. There is a web of mystery growing around the court of King Maximilian and the question of his eccentricity (or insanity) and fitness to be king, but the fact remains, he needs a wife and heir to ensure the security of the crown of Franconia. - Summary by LynneT",

A businessman by profession and poet by avocation, Randolph developed his unique perspective on life from both the practicality of an entrepreneur and the creativity of a writer. This perspective is skillfully enhanced and deftly interpreted in these poems, which illustrate both the poet's quest for meaning, \"Ah, life is all so like this turbid stream! / And frowning walls hem our imperilled path\", and his carefully considered assertions of worldly sagacity, \"But, from its source, each drop bears wisest scheme: / Peace wakes at last from fitful dreams of wrath\".\r\n\r\nRandolph writes of the wonders of nature, the glory of God's creation, and our place in a perplexing but uplifting universe. In keeping with the overall theme of the book, Randolph acknowledges the ephemeral nature of this life and the common journey on which we find ourselves, suggesting, \"Live in the present; for 't is all thou hast;\" and counselling us to \"Use every moment as it were thy last!\".\r\n\r\n - Summary by Bruce Kachuk",
